# IBM-Capstone

This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional 
Certificate offered on Coursera. The capstone applies concepts learned throughout the 
specialization, including data collection, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

In the "Scripts" directory, you will find eight Python scripts that perform various tasks.

01. **Data Collection**: This script collects data from API sources.
02. **Web Scrapping**: This script scrapes data from web pages.
03. **Data Wrangling**: This script cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
04. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: This script performs initial data exploration.
05. **Data Visualization**: This script creates visualizations to understand the data better.
06. **Interactive Map**: This script generates an interactive map using Folium.
07. **Dashboard**: This script creates a dashboard to display the results using dash and plotly.
08. **Machine Learning**: This script applies machine learning algorithms to the data.

## Requirements
To run the scripts, you will need the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- requests
- beautifulsoup
- folium
- dash
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- datetime
- sqllite3

Other packages may be required depending on the specific script.

## Usage
To run the scripts, you can execute them in a Python environment. Make sure to install the required packages using pip:
